   ```

3. **Run the Scanner**:
   You can start using the scanner right away. Check the usage section for more details.

## Usage üìñ

To use the CZD Port Scanner, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python scanner.py -h
```

This will display the help message with all available options. You can specify the target IP, port range, and scanning technique.

### Example Command

To perform a TCP SYN scan on a specific IP address, use:

```bash
python scanner.py -t 192.168.1.1 -p 1-1000 -m tcp-syn
```

### Options

- `-t` or `--target`: Specify the target IP address.
- `-p` or `--ports`: Define the port range (e.g., `1-65535`).
- `-m` or `--method`: Choose the scanning method (`tcp-connect`, `tcp-syn`, `udp`).

## Scanning Techniques üîç

### TCP Connect Scan

This method establishes a full TCP connection with the target. It is straightforward but can be easily detected by firewalls.

### TCP SYN Scan (Stealth)

The TCP SYN scan sends SYN packets and analyzes the responses. It is less likely to be logged by the target, making it stealthier.

### UDP Scanning

UDP scanning checks for open UDP ports. It is more challenging due to the nature of the UDP protocol but essential for a comprehensive scan.
